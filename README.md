# Habibâ€™s Grocery Store

This repository contains the code for a grocery store application that utilizes exponential trees to efficiently search for items, and then uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path for delivery of the item.

## Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/sh06565/DS2-PROJECT-23.git

## Features
The grocery store application has the following features:

- Efficient search using exponential trees
- Shortest path calculation using Dijkstra's algorithm

## Usage
To use the application, simply enter the name of the item you're looking for, and the application will return the shortest path for delivery.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to the development of the grocery store application, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
